Hi, my name is Nelson Mwaura, and this is my Week 3 AI Tools Assignment.

This project demonstrates three categories of AI development:
spaCy for NLP, Scikit-learn for classical machine learning,
and TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning.

First, I used spaCy to perform Named Entity Recognition.
This allowed me to automatically detect names, organizations,
and locations in text — something impossible with regular Python strings.

Next, I used Scikit-learn to build a classical machine learning model.
I trained a simple classifier on sample data and evaluated its accuracy.
This showed how easy and fast Scikit-learn is for traditional ML tasks.

Finally, I used TensorFlow to build a Convolutional Neural Network
trained on the MNIST dataset. This model can recognize handwritten
digits with high accuracy and demonstrates the power of deep learning.

Throughout the project, I also explored the differences between
TensorFlow and PyTorch, and explained how Jupyter Notebooks help in
experimentation and visualization.

Overall, this assignment helped me understand the full workflow of
modern AI development — from NLP, to classical ML, to deep learning.

Thank you for watching.
