# AI Tools Assignment – Week 3

This project demonstrates practical applications of modern AI tools across 
NLP, classical machine learning, and deep learning. It includes:

## 📌 Part 1 – Theoretical Questions
A detailed comparison between TensorFlow and PyTorch, use cases of Jupyter 
Notebooks, and how spaCy improves NLP tasks.

## 📌 Part 2 – Practical Implementations
1. **spaCy NER Notebook (spacy_ner.ipynb)**  
   - Performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) on sample text.

2. **Scikit-Learn Machine Learning Notebook (scikit_classical_ml.ipynb)**  
   - Implements a classical ML model (SVM/DecisionTree/etc.) on sample data.

3. **CNN MNIST Notebook (cnn_mnist.ipynb)**  
   - Uses TensorFlow/Keras to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on 
     the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
